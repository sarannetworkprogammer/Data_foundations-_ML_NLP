        "A well-known application of machine learning is to predict \"customer churn\". Specifically, we want to predict when a customer will \"leave a company\" based on their usage of the service and various customer characteristics. We are going to play with this idea for this task. Specifically, we are going to \"manually\" find the weights to a machine learning algorithm (Logistic Regression) via trial and error. Logistic Regression is defined as\n",
        "$$p = \\frac{1}{1+exp(-\\sum_{i=1}^{i=F} x_i w_i)} = \\frac{1}{1+exp(- [x_1 w_1 + x_2 w_2 + \\cdots + x_F w_F])} $$\n",
        "where $p$ is the prediction, $x_i$ is some user characteristic, e.g., how long a customer has been a customer, and $w_i$ is a weight we will find via trial-and error. The model will generate scores between 0 and 1, thus representing the probaiblity a customer will leave the company within 6 months. A 1 would mean that there is 100\\% probability the customer will leave.\n",
        "\n",
        "**YOUR TASK:** For this exercise, you should **experiment with different weights**. The goal is to find the weights that result in customer 1 receiving a score greater than 0.5 and customer 2 receiving a score less than 0.5. This essentially means that we are predicting customer 1 will leave and customer 2 will not.\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE**: In practice we will use automated methods of finding the weights. The methods that find the weights rely on annotated data. But, this exercise is meant to provide intuition of what the models will do.\n",
